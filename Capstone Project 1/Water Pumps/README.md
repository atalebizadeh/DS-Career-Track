Water is critical to a country’s development, as it is not only used in agriculture but also for industrial development. Whether it’s a drink from the tap, a toilet that works, or a place to wash our hands, having water is a basic necessity that many of us take for granted. But in many parts of the world, women and children spend more than four hours walking for water each day. 
Some African countries like Tanzania might have access to a lot of water, but they still face the dilemmas where many areas have no reliable access to water. In this project, we will use Machine Learning methods to help the Government of Tanzania with predicting which pumps are most likely to stop working so they can prevent the pump failure in advance. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania and the results of this project will aid the maintenance	process and costs.
