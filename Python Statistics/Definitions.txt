Statistical Inference:
A branch of statistics dedicated to drawing conclusions about the world using smaller data samples.

Frequentist inference:
Regards probability as the expected frequency of a particular outcome when an experiment is run multiple times. You’ll generally use this type of inference when your data satisfies certain conditions and there is a theoretical result known for your statistic.

Bootstrap inference:
Simulates such reruns of an experiment to observe the outcomes. This type of inference is particularly useful when theoretical results for your statistic don’t apply (or are difficult to calculate) such as when you want to calculate a confidence interval for a minimum or maximum value for a dataset.
