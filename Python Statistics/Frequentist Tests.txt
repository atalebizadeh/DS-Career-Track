With frequentist tests, you only ever have a single sample (in the sense you're talking here). This does not stop you calculating a CI. Indeed, the whole premise of frequentist testing kinda hangs upon the notion of "IF this experiment were to be repeated many times, what would I expect to see?" With bootstrapping, you basically do repeat the experiment many times (at least, as far as you can, given the original sample) to calculate empirically what happens. And the Bayesian approach really interprets probability differently: as a belief rather than an expected frequency of occurrence.

Coming back to the frequentist approach, if you have a single sample of size N, and you want to conclude something about the population such as its mean, then if N is small, you can naturally intuit that you'll have a pretty wide CI ("I've only seen five examples of this thing, so I'm really not too sure what to expect - my uncertainty is wide"). Whereas if N is very large then you can naturally expect you'll have a much better idea of the population parameter ("I've seen a million examples, so I'm pretty sure the population mean will be very, very close to the sample mean I just calculated"). So the concept of a CI is perfectly valid for a single sample of size N.

You are perfectly correct in saying we only have one sample, not a whole distribution of sample means. The key point with frequentism is making inference about the population based on theoretical results for the sampling distribution. Frequentism, via the Central Limit Theorem, tells us what we can expect that distribution of sample means to look like (normal) if we were to repeat the sampling procedure many, many times. Furthermore, theory tells us that if we calculate this thing called a 95% CI for the mean, then we can expect the true population mean to be contained within this interval 95% of the times we do this. Don't be fooled into thinking you're calculating a CI for the sample mean; you have the sample, it's a done deal, there is no uncertainty, no associated CI - if you calculate a sample mean of 3.4568621 then the sample mean absolutely is 3.4568621. The question is "What do you think the true population mean might be?"
